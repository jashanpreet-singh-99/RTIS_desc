## Introduction

This project was developed with the aim to provide users with advanced SOS services as well as a way to determine the safety of the route they will be taking at any given point in time. Since there are only a limited number of police officers available and weather conditions can greatly affect the safety rating of a region, a model was developed to give the route a safety rating. This safety rating is based on factors such as weather reports, population density, CCTV camera coverage, and police patrolling. The model is then used to plot a safe route for the users.

## Features

1. **Route Safety Prediction**: The project includes a route safety prediction model that takes into account various factors to assign a safety rating to different routes. Users can rely on this rating to choose the safest route for their journey.

2. **Android Application**: The project provides an Android application that offers several features to enhance user safety. Users can upload documents and add emergency contacts within the application. When the SOS signal is activated, designated emergency contacts will be notified.

3. **SOS Signal Activation**: In case of an emergency, users can activate the SOS signal within the application. This triggers the automatic recording of audio from the device and captures images from all available cameras within a 10-second interval. The user's location is also relayed to both the police department and the emergency contacts.

4. **Location Tracking**: The project incorporates location tracking functionality, allowing the user's location to be monitored by the police department and emergency contacts for timely assistance.
